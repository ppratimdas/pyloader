Based on work by John Amend and Nadia Cheng

Simple Python interface for working with a Freeloader machine.
It assumes you have a simple Freeloader consisting of the following:
    - An MX-64 Dynamixel, programmed with ID = 1
    - A Loadstar USB load cell interface

The rest can be specified by the user. Usage is described below.
